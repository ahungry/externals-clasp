The copies of asdf.lisp and README in this directory are complete and
unchanged from the canonical common-lisp.net repository.  They may
lag the CVS version by a few revisions (but shouldn't usually) but
unless we've fouled up horribly, are not forked.

The file asdf-ecl.lisp is kept for historical purposes as a reference, but
its functionality has been superseded by asdf-bundle.
