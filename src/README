#
# Getting externals set up
#
# It's complicated because cmake and openmm have their own
# weird installation systems
#
#  I need to streamline this
#

#
# Make sure that bison-2.5 or greater is installed
#

#
# Make sure doxygen is installed
#
#




#
# create /etc/site-config.jam
# add:  using mpi ;



#
# Install EPD python
# Download it from http://download.enthought.com/epd_7.2/


make cmake-setup
make cmake-install
make openmm-setup


#    In ccmake hit:
#        "c"-configure
#        "e"-exit configure help
#	 "c"-configure (again)
#        "e"-exit configure help
#
# You may need to turn off all OpenCL stuff
#
# Keep hitting "c" and then "g" to configure openmm
#

#
# Install xpath - you may need to do this if openmm-install fails
#
make xpath-install

make openmm-install

make pyopenmm-install



#
# If this doesn't work go back to openmm-setup
#

#
# Finally, make boost/expat and everything else
#

make subAll



 


# If you want to change what boost libraries are compiled...
#
# Edit configure-boost-project-config.jam
#   to change the python libraries that are linked to
#
