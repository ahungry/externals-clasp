Libraries that Clasp depends on.

To build everything from within the top level directory do the following.

1) Copy local.config.darwin or local.config.linux to local.config

2) Edit local.config (ignored by the git repo) and configure it for your system

3) make


Other useful make targets:

make setup - configures all libraries
make subAll - makes all libraries
