dependent-clasp
===============

Libraries that clasp depends on.

To build everything from within the top level directory use:

> make PREFIX={target-directory eg: /home/meister/local/dependent-clasp} TARGET_OS={darwin|linux} install

This will configure all of the dependent libraries and install them in {target-directory}
